   <h2>About Me</h2>
<p> Hello, my name is Donald, and I am excited to share my story with you on my student portfolio website!

I am a  Level 200 University student who is passionate about Fiction. From a young age, I have always been curious about the world around me, and I love to explore new ideas, learn new skills, and take on new challenges.

In school, I am a dedicated student who works hard to achieve academic excellence. I take pride in my ability to Persevere, and I am always looking for new ways to improve and grow as a learner.

Outside of school, I enjoy sports such as Swimming, playing basketball and skateboarding. Whether I am Learning, Playing, or competing, I always strive to do my best and have fun along the way.

Through my student portfolio website, I hope to showcase my academic achievements, personal interests, and unique perspectives. I believe that everyone has a story to tell, and I am excited to share mine with you.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!</p>
